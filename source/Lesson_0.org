- *Platinum* The workbook has several worksheets you will need to add a graph to each.
  - Population - Plot a bar chart of population vs country
  - Temperature - Plot a line graph of date vs minimum temperature
  - Linear1 – Plot a graph representing the equation y = x + 2
  - Linear2 - Plot a graph representing the equation y = 2x + 4
  - Quadratic - Plot a graph representing the equation y = -2(x*x)
  - Heating Curve – use the image to populated the data and plot a line graph
  - Raw Temp – use "text to columns" to clean up the data and plot a of year and month vs hours of sunshine
