* The basics - BBQ
:PROPERTIES:

- You may or may not have used a spreadsheet before.
- In any event, it's probably worth recapping the basic vocabulary used in a spreadsheet, which will help you in the coming lessons.
- The tutorial below walks you through the vocabulary of spreadsheets, writing simple formulae, using AutoSum and using formula replication to save time.

- Try the different techniques for yourself as you watch the tutorial. When you're done, see if you can write out all the odd numbers from 5 to 51, then add them all up.

- Let's pretend you want to host a large BBQ, which you and your friends will all contribute to the cost of.
- A friend has started to produce a spreadsheet to hold all the information you'll need to work out if you have enough money.
- The spreadsheet has some issues and is incomplete.
- When complete it will be able to dynamically calculate whether you have gone under or over budget in regards to holding your BBQ.
- Here is an example of 40 people attending the BBQ, which is what we're working towards:

- We'll need to write some formulae to perform our calculations. 
- The formulae you need are all on show in the screenshot below:
[[./img/0-2.png]]
- Apart from the basic maths calculations you will need to know:
  - Conditional formatting (cell G3)

- *Silver:* You have been asked to plan a BBQ for 60 people, using the following figures:
 - Burgers: 48
 - Hot-dogs: 12
 - Drinks:  1/5 of the guests want Orange, 4/5 want Coke.
- You need to know if £120.00 is sufficient to pay for the cost of your BBQ.
- Complete the formulae above and tidy the spreadsheet, then change the variables (e.g. number of burgers) to those above.
- Upload a screen shot of your completed spreadsheet to collect the badge.
* The basics - Olympic data

- *Gold:* Answer the following questions in the Medal Analysis tab of the workbook 
  - What is the total of all medals awarded?
  -	Who has won the most gold medals in a single sport, in a single year?
  -	How may athletes names are missing?
  -	Replace the missing names with Unknown.
  -	Sort the data by athlete, who appears last on the list?
  -	Sort the data A-Z by country then A-Z by athlete, who is last on the list?
  -	Create a new tab called Brazil, copy and paste all the Brazil data to this new tab.
  -	How old was the youngest medal winner from any country?
  -	How many medals where awarded for Ice Hockey in total?
  -	What was the average age of all the athletes?
  -	How many Olympics did Natalie Ward win 1 or more metals in?

- All graphs MUST:
  - Have a title
  - Have axis labels
  - Be pleasing to the eye
  - Make the data easier to undstand compared to looking at the data itself
  - Use a type of graph that is correct for the data set
- Basic graphs

- *Platinum* The workbook has several worksheets you will need to add a graph to each.
  - Population - Plot a bar chart of population vs country
  - Temperature - Plot a line graph of date vs minimum temperature
  - Linear1 – Plot a graph representing the equation y = x + 2
  - Linear2 - Plot a graph representing the equation y = 2x + 4
  - Quadratic - Plot a graph representing the equation y = -2(x*x)
  - Heating Curve – use the image to populated the data and plot a line graph
  - Raw Temp – use "text to columns" to clean up the data and plot a of year and month vs hours of sunshine
