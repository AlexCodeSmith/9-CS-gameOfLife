- LunchMoney Lewis made a good point.
- Some jobs pay weekly, but most pay you once a month. If you don't plan carefully with your expenditure, you'll find yourself in financial difficulty. 
- As people sometimes say, its easy to find that there's too much month left at the end of the money, and going overdrawn (i.e. having a negative bank balance) can become very expensive, very quickly. 
- Today, you'll learn about how much it actually costs to run a household, using a spreadsheet to help you model it. 
- Some adults use a spreadsheet to help them keep track of their finances, to avoid going overdrawn before the next pay-day.

- Your household budget consists of several categories:
  - Income: Money coming in from your job,
  - Fixed outgoings: Bills that are predictable and regular, e.g. Rent,
  - One-off outgoings: Less regular bills, e.g. Annual TV licence,
  - Unexpected outgoings: Things you can't anticipate, e.g. car breakdown bills.

- In the outgoings column, write as many different types of bill that you can think of in the left column. Don't worry about the amount yet; this will come later.
- In the income section, write your monthly /takehome/ pay amount that you calculated in the last lesson. We can always change this later.

- Use the data above to complete cells =C19=, =C20= and =C21=. 
- Write formulae in cells =C23=, =C24= and =C25= to calculate the hourly rate for a job paying £15,000 per year. 
- Is that more or less than the minimum wage for someone aged 23?

- Complete the formulae above.
- *Silver:* What is the hourly rate for someone on £20,000 a year?
- *Gold:* Find the average UK annual salary, and calculate what this is as an hourly rate. What is the weekly /take-home/ pay for this salary?
- *Platinum:* What is the pre-tax (i.e. not take-home) salary of someone earning £30 per hour?
