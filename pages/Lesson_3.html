<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Everyone wants to live somewhere nice. This means different things to different people though.
</li>
<li>You <i>could</i> rent a house. This means that you pay the owner (known as the Landlord) of a house/flat/bungalow/castle a fixed amount every month and in exchange, you can live there.
</li>
<li>This comes with a number of perks:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If anything breaks (e.g. the boiler, doors, windows, leaky roof), you call the Landlord and it's their responsibility to fix it.
</li>
<li>You're only commited to the house for a relatively short spell (e.g. 6 momths). At the end of that time, you can either sign up for another 6 months or move to another house.
</li>
<li>You don't have to worry about organising mortgages, 
</li>
<li>You can generally (not always!) get a nicer house for less monthly cost than you'd be paying with a mortgage.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>You <i>could</i> get a mortgage. This is a large bank loan that you pay off over a considerable time (25 years normally), paying interest on top of the cost of the house every month. 
</li>
<li>This also comes with a number of perks:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One day, you'll own the house. You won't have to pay to live in the house ever again; renting is for life.
</li>
<li>If you want to knock down a wall, fit a hot tub, build a conservatory or fit a new kitchen, no-one can stop you.
</li>
<li>Once you own it, you have a (typically) 6-figure investment that will slowly increase in value over time. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Both options sound attractive; there's no real right answer here. Both options also have pitfalls though.
</li>
<li>Renting negatives:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You can't change the house without the landlord's permission.
</li>
<li>If the landlord decides to sell the house one day, you may not have the option to extend your contract after it's end-date.
</li>
<li>You've got to pay rent forever. Someone with a mortgage wlil eventually pay it off and enjoy a lot more disposable income.
</li>
<li>The majority of landlords are very good, but some may be slow to respond when there are problems with your property. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Mortgage negatives:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You're on your own. If something breaks, you've got to pay for it, or leave it broken.
</li>
<li>To get a mortgage, the bank will expect you to pay around a 5% deposit of the total cost of the house. A £200,000 house means you'll need to be able to take £10,000 to get the ball rolling. You then have legal fees of around £2000 to pay for a solicitor to transfer the ownership, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax/overviewl">stamp duty</a> to pay on the purchase and you'll need to ensure you have the building itself insured in case of fire or major damage.
</li>
<li>If you ever want to move house, you'll need to sell the house through an estate agent. It can take months or even years to sell, and they'll take a percentage of the sale price (typically around 1%) as their fee.
</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let's find somewhere to live, two different ways.
</li>
<li>Start by opening your budget sheet from last lesson. We'll be changing the value of the rental cost (<code>G4</code>) to see the effect of living in different properties.
</li>
<li>Visit www.RightMove.co.uk in a new browser tab, type 'Bourne' in the location bar and then click 'To rent'.
</li>
<li>Choose Bourne, Lincolnshire on the next page and click 'Find properties'.
</li>
<li>Sort the results by price (highest first).
</li>
<li>Using the pcm (per calendar month) values quoted, try seeing which you can afford.
</li>
<li>Anything that leaves your weekly disposable income as a negative number is one you can't afford, as it'd mean you'd be getting more overdrawn every month and would eventually be evicted. 
</li>
<li>Find the cheapest property that you feel you'd be content to live in, and leave that value in your spreadsheet. How much disposable income do you have?
</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let's try a mortgage for comparisson. 
</li>
<li>The approach here is slightly different. You need to tell the bank how much you earn, then they'll tell you how much mortgage they're willing to lend you.
</li>
<li>Banks will normally lend up to 3.5 times your annual salary as a mortgage. For instance, if you earn £25,000 a year, you could borrow up to £87,500 for a house. 
</li>
<li>You'd also need to find a deposit of 5% of the house you want to buy on top of this. Let's say you'd managed to save £7500, so you could take a mortgage for up to £95,000. 
</li>
<li>Open another browser tab and visit RightMove.co.uk again. Search the same location, but this time only show houses up to £100,000 (people expect to take a little less than they're asking for). 
</li>
<li>How do these houses compare to the ones you were looking at?
</li>
<li>You'll need to know how much the mortgage will cost you each month.
</li>
<li>Visit <a href="http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/mortgage-rate-calculator">this page</a> in a new tab, and enter £87500 in the mortgage debt box. Leave everythin else and click Calculate. You don't need to enter your email address.
</li>
<li>How much is your mortgage each month? How much money do you actually pay for the house by the time you pay it off?
</li>
<li>Try this again, but change the interest rate to 5%. What happens?

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Update your spreadsheet with the rent or mortgage for the property you want. 
</li>
<li>Create a guide for people leaving university to explain how housing works. You should cover:

<li>How renting and mortgages work
</li>
<li>Advantages and disadvantages of Renting vs mortgages
</li>
<li>Which you think is better, and why.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your work will be graded as follows:
</li>
<li><b>Silver:</b> Concepts of renting and mortgage explained.
</li>
<li><b>Gold:</b> Advantages and disadvantages explained, justifying points made.
</li>
<li><b>Platinum:</b> Clear, well-written guide with good spelling, punctuation and grammar. Difference between interest-only and reypayment mortgages explained.
